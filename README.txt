This application is a Restaurant Picker built using jQuery Mobile, HTML and CSS as front-end technology and Django as the back-end technology. 

The front-end code has been generated by Stéphanie Walter under this jQuery Mobile tutorial:

I have developed the back-end code using Django and I have written a basic Django tutorial:
